# OFT Example Deployment

This repository serves the purpose of demonstrating how to deploy an Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) into a production environment. For context, the OFT refers to the LayerZero protocol's extension to the standard ERC20 implementation that most in blockchain are familiar with. <br>

By adopting the OFT standard, liquidity can flow where it is needed and blockchains can communicate seamlessly, in alignment with LayerZero's vision for connecting all blockchains through their leading interoperability technology.

Begin by ensuring you have your development environment set up:

- Node.js
- NPM
- IDE (code editor) such as Visual Studio Code

---

Proceed to install the necessary dependencies to enable you to write, compile and deploy your OFT.

Run `npx create-lz-oapp@latest` in your terminal or code editor. You should be greeted by the LayerZero CLI utility:
