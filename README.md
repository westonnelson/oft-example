# OFT Example Deployment

This repository serves the purpose of demonstrating how to deploy an Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) into a production environment. For context, the OFT refers to the LayerZero protocol's extension to the standard ERC20 implementation that most in blockchain are familiar with. <br>

By adopting the OFT standard, liquidity can flow where it is needed and blockchains can communicate seamlessly, in alignment with LayerZero's vision for connecting all blockchains through their leading interoperability technology.

---

Begin by ensuring you have your development environment set up:

- Node.js
- NPM
- IDE (code editor) such as Visual Studio Code

---

Proceed to install the necessary dependencies to enable you to write, compile and deploy your OFT.
